# agent-behavior-heatmap
Visualize agent performance data using Python, Flask, and Seaborn. Generate heatmaps to identify patterns and areas for improvement based on QA scores. Includes robust data processing, a responsive Flask dashboard, and comprehensive unit tests. Ideal for enhancing agent performance insights.


# Files and their functionality:

1. run.py

	Description: This is the main entry point of the Flask application. It initializes the app by calling the create_app() function and runs the server in debug mode.
	Key Functions:
	•	Initializes the Flask application.
	•	Starts the Flask development server.

2. app/__init__.py

	Description: This file is responsible for creating the Flask application instance. It sets up the configuration, initializes extensions like SQLAlchemy and Flask-Migrate, and registers blueprints.
	Key Functions:
	•	create_app(): Initializes the app, database, and other extensions, and registers blueprints.

3. app/config.py

	Description: Contains the configuration settings for the Flask application, such as database URI and other environment-specific settings.
	Key Functions:
	•	Defines configuration settings that are used throughout the application.

4. app/routes.py

	Description: This file contains the route definitions for the Flask web application. It maps the URL paths to their corresponding view functions.
	Key Functions:
	•	index(): Handles the root route (/) and renders the dashboard with the generated heatmap.

5. app/models.py

	Description: Defines the database models using SQLAlchemy ORM. It includes models such as Agent, InteractionType, and AgentBehavior to represent the data structure.
	Key Functions:
	•	Defines the schema for the application’s database tables.

6. app/utils/data_processing.py

	Description: This utility file handles the loading, processing, and preparation of the data used in the heatmap. It reads data from the CSV file, processes it, and populates the database.
	Key Functions:
	•	load_data(): Loads and processes the agent behavior data from a CSV file.
	•	populate_database(): Populates the database with the processed data.
	•	create_pivot_table(): Generates a pivot table used for heatmap generation.

7. app/utils/visualization.py

	Description: Responsible for generating the heatmap visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib. The heatmap is saved as a PNG file in the static directory.
	Key Functions:
	•	generate_heatmap(): Creates and saves a heatmap image based on the processed data.

8. app/static/img/

	Description: This directory stores the generated heatmap images that are served by the Flask application.
	Key Content:
	•	Contains the agent_behavior_heatmap.png file generated by the application.

9. app/static/css/styles.css

	Description: (If applicable) Contains custom CSS styles for the web application’s front-end, enhancing the visual presentation of the dashboard.
	Key Content:
	•	Defines the styles for HTML elements in the web application.

10. migrations/
